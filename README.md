# GANs
Hello, this repo is a collection of different Generative adversarial networks; it is done for self-training and the proper recreation of the paper architectures because many implementations contain inaccuracies. Also, I've added the `pytorch-lightning` package as a core for the development because I believe the train loop here will be quite the same.

## Data
I have used [BIRDS 400 - SPECIES IMAGE CLASSIFICATION](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) dataset. Because it is not a trivial dataset for the generation, it is not as giant as it can be.

## GANs list:
1. GAN[1]
2. DCGAN[2]
